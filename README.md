# XMTP Website Starter Kit

This web starter is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

This repo will serve as the base for new websites to be built at `xmtp.com` (for XMTP Labs) and `xmtp.org` (for XMTP). Any changes that would need to happen on both sites should be made here, and upstream changes pulled in each individual repo.
